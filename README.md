# Krunker-Aimbot

Copy and paste this script into a new AutoHotkey File and run it

This Script is for aimbot in Krunker

To stop it, press ` (To the left of the 1)

This script will aim at someone's head whenever you right-click

The Record tic will start the aimbot

The Show Gun Radius will just show a green box where the shotgun fires

The Noise Compression is for auto-firing the gun after aiming

The bar saying "compression level" is to control the smoothness of the aimbot
The lower, the faster it foes to the head
